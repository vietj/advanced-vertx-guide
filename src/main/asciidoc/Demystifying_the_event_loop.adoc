= Demystifying the Event Loop
Julien Viet <julien@julienviet.com>

The event loop plays an important role in Vert.x for writing highly scalable and performant network applications.

The event loop is inherited from the Netty library on which Vert.x is based.

We often use the expression _running on the event loop_, it has a very specific meaning: it means that the
current Thread is an event loop thread. This article provides an overview of the Vert.x event loop and the concepts
related to it.

== The golden rule

When using Vert.x there is one Vert.x golden rule to respect:

[quote, Tim Fox]
Never block the event loop!

The code executed on the event loop should never block the event loop, for instance:

- using a blocking method directly or, for instance, reading a file with the `java.io.FileInputStream` api
  or a JDBC connection.
- doing a long and CPU intensive task

When the event loop is blocked:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.setTimer(1, id -> {
  // Blocking the Vert.x event loop
  try {
    Thread.sleep(10000);
  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
});
----

Vert.x will detect it and log a warn:

----

----

The event loop must not be blocked, because it will freeze the parts of the applications using that event loop, with
severe consequences on the scalability and the throughput of the application.

== The context

Beyond the event loop, Vert.x defines the notion of a *_context_*. At a high level, the context can be thought of as
controlling the scope and order in which a set of handlers (or tasks created by handlers) are executed.

When the Vert.x API _consumes_ callbacks (for instance setting an `HttpServer` request handler), it associates a callback handler
with a context. This context is then used for scheduling the callbacks, when such context is needed:

- if the current thread is a Vert.x thread, it reuses the context associated with this thread: the context is propagated.
- otherwise a new context is created for this purpose.

However there is one case where context propagation does not apply: deploying a Verticle creates a new context
for this Verticle, according to the deployment options of the deployment. Therefore a Verticle is always associated
with a context. Any handler registered within a verticle - whether it be an event bus consumer, HTTP server handler,
or any other asynchronous operation - will be registered using the verticleâ€™s context.

Vert.x provides three different types of contexts.

- Event loop context
- Worker context
- Multi-threaded worker context

=== Event loop context

An event loop context executes handlers on an event loop: handlers are executed directly on the IO threads, as
a consequence:

- an handler will always be executed with the same thread
- an handler must never block the thread, otherwise it will create starvation for all the IO tasks associated
with that event loop.

This behavior allows for a greatly simplified threading model by guaranteeing that associated handlers will
always be executed on the same thread, thus removing the need for synchronization and other locking mechanisms.

This is the type of context that is the default and most commonly used type of context. Verticles deployed
without the worker flag will always be deployed with an event loop context.

When Vert.x creates an event loop context, it chooses an event loop for this context, the event loop is chosen
via a round robin algorithm. This can be demonstrated by deploying the same verticle many times:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  int index = i;
  vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
    public void start() throws Exception {
      System.out.println(index + ":" + Thread.currentThread());
    }
  });
}
----

The result is:

----
Thread[main,5,main]
0:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
11:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-11,5,main]
10:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-10,5,main]
13:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-13,5,main]
12:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-12,5,main]

6:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-6,5,main]
15:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-15,5,main]
5:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-5,5,main]
4:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-4,5,main]
3:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-3,5,main]
2:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-2,5,main]
1:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-1,5,main]
17:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-1,5,main]

8:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-8,5,main]
7:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-7,5,main]
----

After sorting the result:

----
Thread[main,5,main]
0:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
1:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-1,5,main]
2:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-2,5,main]
3:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-3,5,main]

5:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-5,5,main]

18:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-2,5,main]
19:Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-3,5,main]
----

As we can see we obtained different event loop threads for each Verticle and the thread are obtained with
a round robin policy. Note that the number of event loop threads by default depends on your CPU but this can
be configured.

An event loop context guarantees to always use the same thread, however the converse is not true: the same thread
can be used by different event loop contexts. The previous example shows clearly that a same thread is used
for different event loops by the Round Robin policy.

The default number of event loop created by a Vertx instance is twice the number of cores of your CPU. This value can
be overriden when creating a Vertx instance:

`link:../../apidocs/org/vietj/vertx/eventloop/ConfigureThreadPool.html#eventLoop--[ConfigureThreadPool.eventLoop]`
----

=== Worker context

Worker contexts are assigned to verticles deployed with the worker option enabled. The worker context is
differentiated from standard event loop contexts in that workers are executed on a separate worker thread pool.

This separation from event loop threads allows worker contexts to execute the types of blocking operations that
will block the event loop: blocking such thread will not impact the application other than blocking one thread.

Just as is the case with the event loop context, worker contexts ensure that handlers are only executed on one
thread at any given time. That is, handlers executed on a worker context will always be executed
sequentially - one after the other - but different actions may be executed on different threads.

A common pattern is to deploy worker verticles and send them a message and then the worker replies to this message:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  @Override
  public void start() throws Exception {
    vertx.eventBus().consumer("the-address", msg -> {
      try {
        Thread.sleep(10);
        System.out.println("Executed by " + Thread.currentThread());
        msg.reply("whatever");
      } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        msg.fail(0, "Interrupted");
      }
    });
  }
}, new DeploymentOptions().setWorker(true));

// Send 10 messages
send(vertx, 10);
----

This prints:

----
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-1,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-2,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-3,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-4,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-5,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-6,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-7,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-8,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-9,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-10,5,main]
Executed by Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-11,5,main]
----

The previous example clearly shows that the worker context of the verticle use different worker threads
for delivering the messages:

However the same thread can be used by several worker verticles:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx(new VertxOptions().setWorkerPoolSize(2));
vertx.deployVerticle(
    TheWorker.class.getName(),
    new DeploymentOptions().setWorker(true).setInstances(4)
);
for (int i = 0;i < 10;i++) {
  vertx.eventBus().send("the-address", "the-message", reply -> {
    System.out.println(reply.result().body());
  });
}
----

This prints:

----
Executed by worker 1 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-1,5,main]
Executed by worker 2 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Executed by worker 1 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-1,5,main]
Executed by worker 2 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Executed by worker 1 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-1,5,main]
Executed by worker 2 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Executed by worker 3 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-1,5,main]
Executed by worker 4 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Executed by worker 3 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-1,5,main]
Executed by worker 4 with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
----

The same worker verticle class can be deployed several times by specifying the number of instances. This allows
to concurrently process blocking tasks:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.deployVerticle(
    TheWorker.class.getName(),
    new DeploymentOptions().setWorker(true).setInstances(3)
);
for (int i = 0;i < 10;i++) {
  vertx.eventBus().send("the-address", "the-message", reply -> {
    System.out.println(reply.result().body());
  });
}
----

Workers can schedule timers:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  @Override
  public void start() throws Exception {
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("Starting timer on " + Thread.currentThread());
    vertx.setTimer(1000, id -> {
      System.out.println("Timer fired " + Thread.currentThread() + " after " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - now) + " ms");
    });
  }
}, new DeploymentOptions().setWorker(true));
----

This prints:

----
Starting timer on Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Timer fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-1,5,main] after 1004 ms
----

Again the timer thread is not the same than the thread that created the timer.

With a periodic timer:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  @Override
  public void start() throws Exception {
    // Using AtomicLong instead of long because local variables referenced from a lambda expression
    // must be final or effectively final
    AtomicLong count = new AtomicLong(10);
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("Starting periodic on " + Thread.currentThread());
    vertx.setPeriodic(1000, id -> {
      if (count.decrementAndGet() < 0) {
        vertx.cancelTimer(id);
      }
      System.out.println("Periodic fired " + Thread.currentThread() + " after " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - now) + " ms");
    });
  }
}, new DeploymentOptions().setWorker(true));
----

we get a different thread for each event:

----
Starting periodic on Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-1,5,main] after 1004 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-2,5,main] after 2004 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-3,5,main] after 3004 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-4,5,main] after 4006 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-5,5,main] after 5004 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-6,5,main] after 6005 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-7,5,main] after 7004 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-8,5,main] after 8005 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-9,5,main] after 9005 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-10,5,main] after 10006 ms
Periodic fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-11,5,main] after 11006 ms
----

Since the worker thread may block, the delivery cannot be guaranteed in time:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  @Override
  public void start() throws Exception {
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("Starting timer on " + Thread.currentThread());
    vertx.setTimer(1000, id -> {
      System.out.println("Timer fired " + Thread.currentThread() + " after " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - now) + " ms");
    });
    Thread.sleep(2000);
  }
}, new DeploymentOptions().setWorker(true));
----

This prints:

----
Starting timer on Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Timer fired Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main] after 2007 ms
----

Just like event loop, the size of the worker thread pool can be configured when creatin a Vertx instance:

[source,java]
----
`link:../../apidocs/org/vietj/vertx/eventloop/ConfigureThreadPool.html#eventLoop--[ConfigureThreadPool.eventLoop]`
----

=== Multi-threaded worker context

Multi-threaded contexts are assigned to verticles deployed with the multi-threaded option enabled. Whereas standard
worker contexts execute actions in order on a variety of threads, the multi-threaded worker context removes the
strong ordering of events to allow the execution of multiple events concurrently. This means that the user is
responsible for performing the appropriate concurrency control such as synchronization and locking.

todo

== Dealing with contexts

Using a context is usually transparent, Vert.x will manage contexts implicitly when deploying a Verticle,
registering an Event Bus handler, etc... However the Vert.x API provides several ways to interact with a Context
allowing for manual context switching.

=== The current context

The static `Vertx.currentContext()` methods returns the current context if there is one, it returns null otherwise.

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
System.out.println("Current context is " + Vertx.currentContext());
----

We get obviously `null` no matter the Vertx instance we created before:

----
Current context is null
----

Now the same from a verticle leads to obtaining the `Verticle` context:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  public void start() throws Exception {
    System.out.println("Current context is " + Vertx.currentContext());
    System.out.println("Verticle context is " + context);
  }
});
----

We get:

----
Current context is io.vertx.core.impl.EventLoopContext@424ff050
Verticle context is io.vertx.core.impl.EventLoopContext@424ff050
----

=== Creating or reusing a context

The `vertx.getOrCreateContext()` method returns the context associated with the current thread (like `currentContext`)
otherwise it creates a new context, associates it to an event loop and returns it:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
Context context = vertx.getOrCreateContext();
System.out.println("Current context is " + Vertx.currentContext());
----

Note, that creating a context, will not associate the current thread with this context. This will indeed not
change the nature of the current thread! However we can now use this context for running an action:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
Context context = vertx.getOrCreateContext();
context.runOnContext(v -> {
  System.out.println("Current context is " + Vertx.currentContext());
});
----

This prints:

----
Current context is io.vertx.core.impl.EventLoopContext@17979104
----

Calling `getOrCreateContext` from a verticle returns the context associated with the Verticle:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  public void start() throws Exception {
    Context context = vertx.getOrCreateContext();
    System.out.println(context);
    System.out.println(vertx.getOrCreateContext());
  }
});
----

This prints:

----
io.vertx.core.impl.EventLoopContext@10b02dc5
io.vertx.core.impl.EventLoopContext@10b02dc5
----

=== Running on context

The `io.vertx.core.Context.runOnContext(Handler)` method can be used when the thread attached to the context needs
to run a particular task on a context.

For instance, the context thread initiates a non Vert.x action, when this action ends it needs to do update some
state and it needs to be done with the context thread to guarantee that the state will be visible by the
context thread.

[source,java]
----
Context context = Vertx.currentContext();

System.out.println("Running with context : " + Vertx.currentContext());

// Our blocking action
Thread thread = new Thread() {
  public void run() {

    // No context here!
    System.out.println("Current context : " + Vertx.currentContext());

    int n = getNumberOfFiles();
    context.runOnContext(v -> {

      // Runs on the same context
      System.out.println("Runs on the original context : " + Vertx.currentContext());
      numberOfFiles = n;
    });
  }
};

//
thread.start();
----

This prints:

----
Running with context : io.vertx.core.impl.EventLoopContext@69cdd6d8
Current context : null
Runs on the original context : io.vertx.core.impl.EventLoopContext@69cdd6d8
----

The `vertx.runOnContext(Handler<Void>)` is a shortcut for what we have seen before: it calls the
`getOrCreateContext` method and schedule a task for execution via the `context.runOnContext(Handler<Void>)` method.

=== Blocking

Before Vert.x 3, using blocking API required to deploy a worker Verticle. Vert.x 3 provides an additional API
for using a blocking API:

[source,java]
----
vertx.runOnContext(v -> {

  // On the event loop
  System.out.println("Calling blocking block from " + Thread.currentThread());

  Handler<Future<String>> blockingCodeHandler = future -> {
    // Non event loop
    System.out.println("Computing with " + Thread.currentThread());
    future.complete("some result");
  };

  Handler<AsyncResult<String>> resultHandler = result -> {
    // Back to the event loop
    System.out.println("Got result in " + Thread.currentThread());
  };

  // Execute the blocking code handler and the associated result handler
  vertx.executeBlocking(blockingCodeHandler, resultHandler);
});
----

This prints:

----
Calling blocking block from Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
Computing with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Got result in Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
----

While the blocking action executes with a worker thread, the result handler is executed with the same event
loop context.

The blocking action is provided a `Future` argument that is used for signaling when the result is obtained,
usually a result of the blocking API.

When the blocking action fails the result handler will get the failure as cause of the async result object:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.runOnContext(v -> {

  Handler<Future<String>> blockingCodeHandler = future -> {
    throw new RuntimeException();
  };

  Handler<AsyncResult<String>> resultHandler = result -> {
    if (result.succeeded()) {
      System.out.println("Got result");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Blocking code failed");
      result.cause().printStackTrace(System.out);
    }
  };

  vertx.executeBlocking(blockingCodeHandler, resultHandler);
});
----

This prints:

----
Blocking code failed
java.lang.RuntimeException
at org.vietj.vertx.eventloop.ExecuteBlockingThrowingFailure.lambda$null$0(ExecuteBlockingThrowingFailure.java:19)
at org.vietj.vertx.eventloop.ExecuteBlockingThrowingFailure$$Lambda$4/163784093.handle(Unknown Source)
at io.vertx.core.impl.ContextImpl.lambda$executeBlocking$2(ContextImpl.java:217)
at io.vertx.core.impl.ContextImpl$$Lambda$6/1645685573.run(Unknown Source)
at io.vertx.core.impl.OrderedExecutorFactory$OrderedExecutor.lambda$new$180(OrderedExecutorFactory.java:91)

at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)
at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
----

The blocking action can also report the failure on the `Future` object:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.runOnContext(v -> {

  Handler<Future<String>> blockingCodeHandler = future -> {
    try {
      throw new Exception();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      future.fail(e);
    }
  };

  Handler<AsyncResult<String>> resultHandler = result -> {
    if (result.succeeded()) {
      System.out.println("Got result");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Blocking code failed");
      result.cause().printStackTrace(System.out);
    }
  };

  vertx.executeBlocking(blockingCodeHandler, resultHandler);
});
----

Obviously executing a task from the blocking action on the context will use the event loop:

[source,java]
----
vertx.runOnContext(v -> {

  // On the event loop
  System.out.println("Calling blocking block from " + Thread.currentThread());

  Handler<Future<String>> blockingCodeHandler = future -> {
    // Non event loop
    System.out.println("Computing with " + Thread.currentThread());

    // Running on context from the worker
    vertx.runOnContext(v2 -> {
      System.out.println("Running on context from the worker " + Thread.currentThread());
    });
  };

  // Execute the blocking code handler and the associated result handler
  vertx.executeBlocking(blockingCodeHandler, result -> {});
});
----

Which outputs:

----
Calling blocking block from Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
Computing with Thread[vert.x-worker-thread-0,5,main]
Running on context from the worker Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
----

This API is somewhat similar to deploying a worker Verticle, although its purpose is to execute a single
blocking operation from an event loop context.

CAUTION: while the `executeBlocking` is a `Vertx` method, the blocking actions are scheduled on the underlying
context and serialized, i.e executed one after another and not in parallel.

Execute blocking for any particular verticle instance uses the same context as that instance.

By default, if you call `executeBlocking` multiple times in any particular instance they will be executed in the order you
called them. If we didn't do that you'd get into a mess, e.g. if you did an insertBlocking to insert
some data into a table, followed by another to select from that table, then there'd be no guarantee in which
order they occurred so you might not find your data.

When several blocking tasks are submitted, the current implementation picks an available worker for executing
the first task, after its execution, it will execute any pending tasks. After the executions of all the tasks,
the worker stops and goes back in the worker pool.

It is possible to execute also unordered blocks, i.e the blocks can be executed in parallel by setting the
`ordered` argument to `false`:

[source,java]
----
vertx.runOnContext(v -> {

  // The blocks are executed on any available worker thread
  vertx.executeBlocking(blockingCodeHandler1, false, ar -> {});
  vertx.executeBlocking(blockingCodeHandler2, false, ar -> {});
  vertx.executeBlocking(blockingCodeHandler3, false, ar -> {});
});

=== Determining the kind of context

The kind of a context can be determined with the methods:

- `Context#isEventLoopContext`
- `Context#isWorkerContext`
- `Context#isMultiThreadedWorkerContext`

WARNING: the nature of the context does not guarantee the nature of the thread, indeed the `executeBlocking`
method can execute a task with a worker thread in an event loop context

=== Determining the kind of thread

As said earlier, the nature of the context impacts the concurrency. The `executeBlocking` method can even change
use a worker thread in an event loop context. The kind of context should be properly determined with the static methods:

- `Context#isOnEventLoopThread()`
- `Context#isOnWorkerThread()`

=== Concurrency

When the Vert.x API needs a context, it calls the `vertx.getOrCreateContext()` method, when the Vert.x API is used
in a context, for instance when deploying a Verticle. This implies that any service created from this Verticle
will reuse the same context, for instance:

- Creating a server
- Creating a client
- Creating a timer
- Registering an event but handler
- etc...

Such _services_ will call back the Verticle that created them at some point, how this happens is according
to the context: the context remains the same, however its nature has a direct impact on the concurrency as it
govers the threading model:

[source,java]
----
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  int value = 0;
  @Override
  public void start() throws Exception {
    vertx.setPeriodic(100, id -> value++);
    vertx.eventBus().consumer("the-address", msg -> {
      msg.reply(value);
    });
  }
});
----

Deployed as a worker, no exclusion is required, however the changes must be visibles between threads, pretty much like this:

[source,java]
----
vertx.deployVerticle(new AbstractVerticle() {
  volatile int value;
  @Override
  public void start() throws Exception {
    vertx.setPeriodic(100, id -> value++);
    vertx.eventBus().consumer("the-address", msg -> {
      msg.reply(value);
    });
  }
}, new DeploymentOptions().setWorker(true));
----

== Embedding Vert.x

When Vert.x is embedded like in a _main_ Java method or a _junit_ test, the thread creating Vert.x can be any kind of thread, but
it is certainly not a Vert.x thread. Any action that requires a context will implicitly create an event loop context for
executing this action.

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
HttpServer server = vertx.createHttpServer();
server.listen(result -> {
  // This runs in a context created just for the purpose of this http server
});
----

When several actions are done, there will use different context and there are high chances they will use a
different event loop thread.

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(requestHandler).listen(result -> {
  // This executes in a context
  System.out.println("Current thread is " + Thread.currentThread());
  });
vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(requestHandler).listen(result -> {
  // This executes in a different context
  System.out.println("Current thread is " + Thread.currentThread());
  });
----

This prints:

----
Current thread is Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-1,5,main]
Current thread is Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
----

Therefore accessing a shared state from both servers should not be done!

When the same context needs to be used then the actions can be grouped with a `runOnContext` call:

[source,java]
----
Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
vertx.runOnContext(v -> {
  vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(requestHandler).listen(result -> {
    // This executes in a context
    System.out.println("Current thread is " + Thread.currentThread());
  });
  vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(requestHandler).listen(result -> {
    // This executes in the same context
    System.out.println("Current thread is " + Thread.currentThread());
  });
});
----

This prints:

----
Current thread is Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
Current thread is Thread[vert.x-eventloop-thread-0,5,main]
----

Now we can share state between the two servers safely.

== Vert.x Core apis

Vert.x API consumes handlers and assign them to context, this section provides a quick overview of the Vert.x
Core APIs.

=== TCP Servers

TCP servers (HttpServer and NetServer) can run with both event loop and worker contexts. A TCP server consumes
a context for the various handlers it uses.

A worker server uses under the hood an event loop for its IO operations, however the worker context is used
for calling the registered handlers. Consequently a worker server can block directly, when it happens, this will
not have consequences on the underlying event loop, however it does impact directly the server, as this particular
server will be blocked: of course the server can be scaled to many workers to handle multiple blocking requests
concurrently, this is the classic multithreaded server model.

=== TCP Clients

TCP clients (HttpClient and NetClient) can run with both event loop and worker contexts. Clients don't have a particular
context assigned. A context is instead assigned every time a connection or a request is done.

=== Timers

Every time a timer or periodic is created, a context is assigned, this context is then used when the timer or
periodic fires. Event bus or worker contexts are allowed.

=== Event bus

A context is assigned when an handler is registered for consuming a message, it can be a registered consumer
or registering a message reply handler. Event bus or worker contexts are allowed.
